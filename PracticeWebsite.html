He's tall, handsome and very intelligent guy with an amazing personality to go with his great looks. He's very talented, is amazing at what he does. Usually he has black/brown curly hair. He has the greatest sense of humor. though no one would know because he is as shy as he is good looking. He is probably the best kisser you will ever meet and knows how to have a good time. Does amazing things in bed, is very loving and caring and would do anything for the ones he loves. But he's not interested in breaking your heart. He will never try to pressure you into sex. He is amazing to you. And he wont let you ever talk down about yourself. The greatest love one could have would be with Charles."</h2>
